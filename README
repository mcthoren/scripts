just a collection of small simple shell scripts i wind up using often.

TODO:
+ rpi_initial_setup.yml
  - remove dyn stuff from nsswitch
  - can i assign a host name from ansible based on ip?
  - debug why i have to set a pass for a user before i log in with a key (did this once, forgot)
  - figure a way to do figlet motd's w.o. a change popping up each time
  - set locales with ansible
  - expand fs with ansible
  - get ipv6 going again (for what must be like the 4th time...)
